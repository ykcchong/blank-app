The hospital has contingency measures to ensure hospitalisation of emergency patients needing admission when there is no bed in the department for which the patient is supposed to be admitted. \nThe hospital has and implements a management policy and procedures for patients in the emergency department under observation; a management and coordination mechanism to timely and properly deal with patients who are under observation in the emergency department for more than 72 hours, so as to gradually decrease the proportion of hospitalised patients for observation in the emergency department. \nIn accordance with evidence-based guidelines, clinical best practices and the expectations and characteristics of patients, the multidisciplinary team formulates hospital-wide multidisciplinary clinical pathways for major acute and critical diseases or major diseases (such as acute trauma, acute myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, acute stroke, acute brain injury, acute respiratory failure, high-risk pregnant women, high-risk pregnancy and the newborn), to be applicable to the entire patient journey. [Also see Quality 6.2.2]. These clinical pathways contain clear indications on clinical management process to be undertaken and service timeframes to be met, treatment objectives and key elements of care. Implementation of clinical pathways should be documented in detail in the medical record, to serve as the basis for medical care throughout the hospitalisation episode, and to continuously document the treatment the patient has received and its effectiveness. Clinical audit results and data are used to continuously improve and standardise clinical processes. \nThe hospital's multidisciplinary emergency and critical illness services for patients should be documented in clinical records in detail, which serve as the basis for medical care throughout the patient's treatment process, as well as a part of the medical record to continuously document the treatment the patient has received and its effectiveness. \nThe multi-disciplinary team considers and applies currently recognised clinical practice guidelines, operation procedures and guidelines, and professional standards, and formulates emergency and critical illness service standards, covering various disciplines for implementation in the whole hospital with reference to evidence-based medicine and best practice and patient expectations and characteristics. The standards specify the service procedures and time limits, cover the complete treatment process, and clearly clarify treatment aims and key factors [Also see Quality 3.1.2]. \nBy improving and standardising clinical procedures, the hospital aims to reduce risks, duplications and variations in clinical practice so as to improve treatment efficacy and outcome, enhance patient safety and optimise resource utilisation. \nAccording to its actual situation and patient-centred philosophy, the hospital chooses to take up service standards for multidisciplinary management of patients with emergent, critical and major illnesses, the catalogue of major disease groups with standardised texts, so as to promote communication and coordination between team members, patients and family members, and among multiple clinical specialties and departments, with records. \nThe quality control team of the hospital and related departments conducts regular drills on the rescue of emergency and critically ill patients and service standards.
